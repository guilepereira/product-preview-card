## My process

My process consisted of developing the design for desktop, following with tests and subsequent code organization. After this step, I started the development of responsiveness, always following the requirements of the challenge specification as much as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup;
- CSS custom properties;
- Flexbox;
- Methodology BEM (Block Element Modifier).

### What I learned

The main objective was to regain practice, which I intend to improve with feedback and learning from these first exercises.

As one of my first exercises, I was able to think about a process in an experimental way, aware of some good practices, I chose to start simple and apply the best I could.
